* Legal Issues

Some countries have regulations on the use of cryptographics systems; it
may be unlawful to use GnuPG in these countries.

For a guide to International Laws regarding cryptography, please see
Bert-Jaap Koops' [[http://rechten.uvt.nl/koops/cryptolaw/index.htm][Crypto Law Survey]] .

Note that in January 2000, the US Department of Commerce relaxed the
rules about [[http://www.crypto.com/exports/][exporting]] cryptography, in particular for free software
projects.
