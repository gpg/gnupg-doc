** GnuPG does not detect injection of unsigned data (2006-03-09 20:02:28)

In the aftermath of the false positive signature verification bug more
thorough testing of the fix has been done and another vulnerability has
been detected. This new problem affects the use of gpg for verification
of signatures which are not detached signatures. The problem also
affects verification of signatures embedded in encrypted messages; i.e.
standard use of gpg for mails. Update GnuPG as soon as possible to
version 1.4.2.2!

** False positive signature verification in GnuPG (2006-02-15 12:43:54)

The Gentoo project identified a security related bug in GnuPG. When
using any current version of GnuPG for unattended signature verification
(e.g. by scripts and mail programs), false positive signature
verification of detached signatures may occur. This problem affects the
tool *gpgv*, as well as using "gpg --verify" to imitate gpgv, if only
the exit code of the process is used to decide whether a detached
signature is valid.

-  Tiger has now the OpenPGP assigned number 6. Because the OID has
   changed, old signatures using this algorithm can't be verified.
-  GnuPG now encrypts the compressed packed and not any longer in the
   reverse order; anyway it can decrypt both versions.
-  =--add-key= works and you are now able to generate subkeys.
-  It is now possible to generate ElGamal keys in v4 packets to create
   valid OpenPGP keys.
-  Some new features for better integration into MUAs.

-  Add key generation for DSA and v4 signatures.
-  Fixed a small bug in the key generation.
-  New option =--compress-algo 1= to allow the creation of compressed
   messages which are readable by PGP.


** GnuPG 0.2.17 released (1998-05-04)

** GnuPG 0.2.16 released (1998-04-28)
