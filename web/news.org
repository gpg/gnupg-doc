** Libgcrypt 1.6.0 released (2013-10-16)

The GNU project is pleased to announce the availability of Libgcrypt
version 1.6.0.  This is the new stable version of Libgcrypt with the API
being mostly compatible to previous versions.  Due to the removal of
certain long deprecated functions this version introduces an ABI
change.

The main features of this version are performance improvements,
better support for elliptic curves, new algorithms and modes, as well as
API and internal cleanups.  [[http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2013q4/000336.html][{more}]]

** New website infrastructure (2013-11-12)

After more than a decade we switched from the legacy WML based website
system to a new [[http://org-mode.org][org-mode]] based one.  The old WML code was not anymore
maintainable and building the website took way to long.  The new
system uses plain text files and will make it way easier to keep
information up to date.  Unfortunately the translations are gone for
now --- most of them have not been updated for many years anyway.

** GnuPG does not detect injection of unsigned data (2006-03-09 20:02:28)

In the aftermath of the false positive signature verification bug more
thorough testing of the fix has been done and another vulnerability has
been detected. This new problem affects the use of gpg for verification
of signatures which are not detached signatures. The problem also
affects verification of signatures embedded in encrypted messages; i.e.
standard use of gpg for mails. Update GnuPG as soon as possible to
version 1.4.2.2!
[[http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2006q1/000216.html][{more}]]


** False positive signature verification in GnuPG (2006-02-15 12:43:54)

The Gentoo project identified a security related bug in GnuPG. When
using any current version of GnuPG for unattended signature verification
(e.g. by scripts and mail programs), false positive signature
verification of detached signatures may occur. This problem affects the
tool *gpgv*, as well as using "gpg --verify" to imitate gpgv, if only
the exit code of the process is used to decide whether a detached
signature is valid.
