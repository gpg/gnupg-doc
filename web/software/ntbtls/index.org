* The Not Too Bad TLS Library

  /ntbTLS/ is a tiny TLS 1.2 only implementation designed to be used
  with Libgcrypt and LibKSBA.  In particular, this library has no
  certificate verification code - this need to be done by the caller.
  For example the GnuPG component /dirmngr/ already has code to verify
  certificates (for CRL and OCSP checking) and thus /ntbTLS/ is a good
  fit for accessing objects over the network.

  *WARNING:* Although this library is based on code from PolarSSL (now
  known as [[https://tls.mbed.org/][mbedTLS]]) it is pretty young and NOT WELL TESTED.

  See the [[../../download/index.org::ntbtls][download]] section for the latest tarball.

  The development takes place in a Git repo:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   git clone git://git.gnupg.org/ntbtls.git
#+END_EXAMPLE
