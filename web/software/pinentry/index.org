* pinentry

  /pinentry/ is a small collection of dialog programs that allow GnuPG
  to read passphrases and PIN numbers in a secure manner. There are
  versions for the common GTK and Qt toolkits as well as for the text
  terminal (Curses).

  See the [[../../download/index.org::pinentry][download]] section for the latest tarball.

  The development takes place in a Git repo:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   git clone git://git.gnupg.org/pinentry.git
#+END_EXAMPLE
  For more information see our [[../../download/git.org][Git page]].
