* Libksba

  /Libksba/ is a library to make the tasks of working with X.509
  certificates, CMS data and related objects more easy. It provides a
  highlevel interface to the implemented protocols and presents the
  data in a consistent way. There is no more need to worry about all
  the nasty details of the protocols. The API gives the C programmer
  an easy way of interacting with the data. It copes with the version
  details X.509 protocols tend to have as well as with the many
  different versions and dialects. Applications must usually cope with
  all of this and it has to be coded over and over again. /Libksba/
  hides this by providing just one API which does the Right
  Thing\trade. Support for new features will be added as needed.

  See the [[../../download/index.org::libksba][download]] section for the latest tarball.

  The development takes place in a Git repo:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   git clone git://git.gnupg.org/libksba.git
#+END_EXAMPLE
