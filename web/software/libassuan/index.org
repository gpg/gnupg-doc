* Libassuan

  /Libassuan/ is a small library implementing the so-called /Assuan
  protocol/. This protocol is used for IPC between most newer GnuPG
  components. Both, server and client side functions are provided.

  In an ideal world, Assuan is irrelevant. Assuan's primary use is to
  allow a client to interact with a non-persistent server. Using
  Assuan, this is accomplished by forking a subprocess and
  communicating with it via, for example, a pipe or unix domain
  socket. This method is neither elegant nor efficient especially when
  there is a lot of data spread across several transactions: not only
  is there a penalty for an increased number of context switches, but
  also a significant amount of data is memcpy-ed from the client to a
  file descriptor and from the file descriptor to the server. Despite
  these and other disadvantages, this type of client/server
  communication can be useful: the client is completely separate from
  the server; they are in different address spaces. This is especially
  important in situations where the server must have a known degree of
  reliability and data must be protected: as the Assuan protocol is
  well defined and clients cannot corrupt the servers' address space,
  auditing become much easier.

  Assuan was developed for use by the GNU Privacy Guard, GnuPG, to
  prevent potentially buggy clients from unwittingly corrupting
  sensitive transactions or compromising data such as a secret
  key. Assuan permits the servers, which do the actual work,
  e.g. encryption and decryption of data using a secret key, to be
  developed independently of the user interfaces, e.g. mail clients
  and other encryption front ends. Like a shared library, the
  interface is well defined and any number of front ends can use it;
  however, unlike a shared library, the client cannot see or touch the
  server's data. As with any modular system, Assuan helps keep the
  servers small and understandable, and helps to make code more
  understandable and less error prone.

  Assuan is not, however, limited to use with GnuPG servers and
  clients: it was design to be flexible enough to meet the demands of
  almost any transaction based environment with non-persistent
  servers.
