* The New GNU Portable Threads Library

  /nPth/ is a library to provide the GNU Pth API and thus a
  non-preemptive threads implementation.

  In contrast to GNU Pth is is based on the system's standard threads
  implementation.  This allows the use of libraries which are not
  compatible to GNU Pth.  Experience with a Windows Pth emulation
  showed that this is a solid way to provide a co-routine based
  framework.

  See the [[../../download/index.org::npth][download]] section for the latest tarball.

  The development takes place in a Git repo:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   git clone git://git.gnupg.org/npth.git
#+END_EXAMPLE
  For more information see our [[../../download/git.org][Git page]].
