* Project Ägypten2: Improving Free Software Sphinx-Clients

  Ägypten2 is a successor project of Ägypten1, but with its own technical
  aims, primarily addressing a better GUI and some more functionality such
  as OCSP. The Ägypten2 project has the same structural and organisational
  frame as Ägypten1, started December 1st 2003 and finished in
  November 2004.

  Please read the [[../aegypten/index.org][Ägypten1 Web-Pages]] to learn about the project that
  initially estabslished the Sphinx (S/MIME) awareness of the MUAs
  KMail and Mutt.

** Aims

   The rough list of aims and their status (as of 13-January-2005) of
   the Ägypten2 project are:

   - Certificate Manager/Dirmngr

     - GUI for PSE management (done)
     - GUI for importating centrally created keys (done)
     - Manual installation of CRLs (done)
     - Check validity of all certifiactes (done)
     - Visual distinction of certificate validity and usage (done)
     - OCSP support (done)
     - serial signatures based on the MIME structures (done)
     - GUI for configuring LDAP servers (done)

   - KMail

     - Better support for handling keys with different key usages (done)
     - GUI for specifying set and sequence of DN elements to show in
       KMail (done)
     - Detection of encrypted messages even if not correctly suffixed
       ".p7m" (done)
     - Consistent and correct handling of drafts (done)

   - Support of DINSIG Smartcards (DIN V66291-1:2000-04) (done)
   - Extend Mutt to support S/MIME based on Ägypten crypto-backend
     (done)
   - Interoperability with other Sphinx-Applications (established)
   - KDE GUI for watching GnuPG log (done)
   - Complete German translation (almost done)
   - Merge Ägypten developments into main development branches,
     especially the KDE parts (done)
   - Incorporate full functionality into Debian (in progress, only
     GpgSM missing)
   - Finish work in summer 2004 (well November was not too bad,
     considering that the official Sphinx Interoperability Test
     performed by Atos Origin took place in the last week of October).

** Module Overview

** Users

   Basically Ägypten2 is ready for use. The technology passed
   interoperability tests with a number of leading other Sphinx
   products (in fact most of them being proprietary Outlook
   plugins). Of course, there could still be some remaining bugs.

   If your are interested in the OpenPGP part, there is a HOWTO
   provided by kde.org: [[http://kmail.kde.org/kmail-pgpmime-howto.html][Using OpenPGP and PGP/MIME with KMail >= 1.7]]
   Most of the described stuff is also required for S/MIME.

   Since the release of KDE 3.3 (and therewith KMail 1.7), all KDE
   elements of Ägypten2 are available with the standard KDE 3.3 (or
   newer) packages.

   However, the various packages of Ägypten2 did not yet made it into
   the usual GNU/Linux distributions.

   Please report us if you find a distibution where Ägypten2
   (especially the S/MIME part) works on your distribution out of the
   box or at least most parts are available as packages.

*** Debian Sarge

    Ägypten-2 funtionality is fully integrated in Debian 'Sarge' 3.1.

#+begin_example
 apt-get install gnupg libgpg-error0 libgcrypt11 libgpgme11
 apt-get install dirmngr
 apt-get install pinentry-curses pinentry-gtk pinentry-qt
 apt-get install gnupg2
#+end_example

    In case you want to compiler newer versions than the Sarge ones
    you might need some developer packages of which some are available
    as packages:

    apt-get install libgpg-error-dev libgcrypt11-dev libassuan-dev
    libgpgme11-dev

    KDE >= 3.3 is also available in Sarge:

    apt-get install kmail kleopatra # the minimum you should install
    apt-get install kaddressbook # to use contact specific crypto
    preferences apt-get install kontact # to have various PIM
    components integrated

** Developers

*** Issue Tracker

    Roundup [[http://intevation.de/roundup/aegypten/][Ägypten Issue Tracker]]

    (previously we used an [[http://intevation.de/rt/webrt?q_queue=aegypten][RT-based issues tracker for Ägypten]]. Please
     report new bugs only into the new Roundup-based one.)

*** Subversion

    First make sure you installed

    -  [[https://www.gnupg.org][GnuPG]] >= 1.2.5
    -  [[https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/libgpg-error/][libgpg-error]]
       >= 1.0.0
    -  [[http://directory.fsf.org/security/libgcrypt.html][libgcrypt]] >=
       1.2.0
    -  [[https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/index.html][GpgME]]
       >= 1.0.0
    -  [[http://www.kde.org][KDE]] >= 3.3.0

    The full procedure is (you may apply short-cuts for some modules
    e.g.  via tar-balls. Note also that after installing libraries you
    may have to issue ldconfig to have the newly installed libraries
    be found by subsequent configure routines. Note finally that you
    should read README.SVN if you find one):

    1. Build libassuan

       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
               svn co svn://cvs.gnupg.org/libassuan/trunk libassuan
               cd libassuan
               ./autogen.sh
               ./configure --prefix=/some/where --enable-maintainer-mode
               make install

       #+END_EXAMPLE

       Alternatively you may use the latest tarball from
       [[ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/libassuan/][ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/libassuan/]] and do the usual
       =./configure && make install=.

    2. Build libksba

       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
               svn co svn://cvs.gnupg.org/libksba/trunk libksba
               cd libksba
               ./autogen.sh
               ./configure --prefix=/some/where --enable-maintainer-mode
               make install

       #+END_EXAMPLE

       Alternatively you may use the latest tarball from
       [[ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/libksba/][ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/libksba/]]
       and do the usual =./configure && make install=.

    3. Build GnuPG 1.9 (make sure you build with thread support, or else
       some operations may hang)

       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
               svn co svn://cvs.gnupg.org/gnupg/trunk gnupg
               cd gnupg
               ./autogen.sh
               ./configure --prefix=/some/where --enable-maintainer-mode
               make install

       #+END_EXAMPLE

       Alternatively you may use the latest tarball from
       [[ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gnupg/][ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/gnupg/]]
       (take the latest =gnupg-1.9.x=) and do the usual
       =./configure && make install=.

    4. Build DirMngr

       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
               svn co svn://cvs.gnupg.org/dirmngr/trunk dirmngr
               cd dirmngr
               ./autogen.sh
               ./configure --prefix=/some/where --enable-maintainer-mode
               make install

       #+END_EXAMPLE

       Alternatively you may use the latest tarball from
       [[ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/dirmngr/][ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/alpha/dirmngr/]]
       and do the usual =./configure && make install=.

    5. Build pinentry module

       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
               svn co svn://cvs.gnupg.org/pinentry/trunk pinentry
               cd pinentry
               ./autogen.sh
               ./configure --prefix=/some/where --enable-maintainer-mode
               make install

       #+END_EXAMPLE

       Alternatively you may use the latest tarball from
       [[ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/pinentry/][ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/pinentry/]]
       and do the usual =./configure && make install=.
