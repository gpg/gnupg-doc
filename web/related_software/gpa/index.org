* GPA - The Gnu Privacy Assistant

  The /GNU Privacy Assistant/ (GPA) is a graphical user interface for
  the [[../../index.en.html][GnuPG]] (GNU Privacy Guard).

  GPA utilizes [[http://www.gtk.org][GTK+]] (the GIMP Tool Kit) and compiles for various
  platforms. You can have a look at some [[file:screenshots.org][screenshots]] . You can learn

  GPA is available at the [[ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gpa//][GnuPG FTP server]] and its mirrors.
