* The People behind GnuPG

  As with all technical things in the world, people and not machines
  created them and are responsible to keep them running.  Software and
  thus GnuPG is no different.  Although software is built using a lot
  of other software and thus the work of many thousands of people, you
  may be interested to see who is working on GnuPG.  Here is a list of
  some of them:

   /Core components maintainer/

   Werner started GnuPG in 1997 and still puts most of his working
   time into the development and maintenance of GnuPG.  He has 29
   years experience in commercial software development on systems
   ranging from CP/M systems to mainframes, languages from assembler
   to Smalltalk and applications from drivers to financial analysis
   systems.  Werner is a long time free software supporter and
   co-founder of the [[http://fsfe.org][FSFE]].  With the support of his brother he founded
   [[https://g10code.com][g10^code]] GmbH in 2001 to make GnuPG development his profession.
   Werner is managing director and an associate of [[https://g10code.com][g10^code]] GmbH.

   /Master of the classic branch/

   David approached the GnuPG Project in 2002 after the relaxing of
   the US crypto regulation allowed the participation of US based
   hackers on international crypto projects.  One of his first
   achievements was a much improved Web-of-Trust implementation.
   Today he mainly takes responsibility for the keyserver access and
   the classic GnuPG 1.x branch.

* Former developers

   The following developers made large contributions to GnuPG in the past
   but are, sadly, no longer active GnuPG developers.

   Most are still working on improving the OpenPGP ecosystem and we wish
   them the very best.
