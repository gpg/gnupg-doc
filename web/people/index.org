* The People behind GnuPG

  As with all technical things in the world, people and not machines
  created them and are responsible to keep them running.  Software and
  thus GnuPG is no different.  Although software is built using a lot
  of other software and thus the work of many thousands of people, you
  may be interested to see who is working on GnuPG.  Here is a list of
  some of them:

   time into the development and maintenance of GnuPG.  He has 29
   years experience in commercial software development on systems
   ranging from CP/M systems to mainframes, languages from assembler
   to Smalltalk and applications from drivers to financial analysis
   systems.  Werner is a long time free software supporter and

   David approached the GnuPG Project in 2002 after the relaxing of

   hackers on international crypto projects.  One of his first
   achievements was a much improved Web-of-Trust implementation.
   Today he mainly takes responsibility for the keyserver access and
   the classic GnuPG 1.x branch.
