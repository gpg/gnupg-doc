A complete list of all mailing lists can also be found at our
[[https://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/][mailing list manager]].

You may subscribe to these lists [[https://lists.gnupg.org/][via web]] or by sending an e-mail:

#+begin_example
  To: <mailing_list>-request@gnupg.org
  Subject: subscribe
#+end_example

where /<mailing_list>/ is the name of the mailing list as described
above.

Posting to these mailing lists is only allowed for subscribers;
postings from non-subscribers are held for approval but there is no
guarantee that the moderator can approve them in time; they may even
be dropped.

Some kinds of postings will not be accepted: e.g. large ones, mails
without the list name in the =To:= or =CC:= header and HTML mails.
All mail clients have an option to send plain text only messages; try
this if you donâ€™t get a response.

Please write to the mailing lists in English unless it is language
specific list.

** Other discussion groups

There are also several other country-specific mailing-lists to
subscribe to.  It is important to note that these mailing-lists are
not hosted on the GnuPG servers, but are of great help for all of
those who feel more confortable when speaking their own native
language.

-  [[http://www.egroups.co.jp/group/gnupgnewsjapan/][GnuPG News Japan]] :: Discussion group for Japanese users.
-  [[http://itlists.org/mailman/listinfo/gnupg-it/][gnupg-it]] :: Mailing list dedicated to GnuPG users who speak Italian.

* IRC and Jabber

The channel =#gnupg= on =irc.freenode.org= is a place to talk about
all gnupg related topics.

The core GnuPG developers use the Jabber MUC =gnupg-devel= at chat dot
