* HOWTOs

  There are several HOWTOs available.  Unfortunately some of them are
  not up-to-date.


** Web Key Directory Installation HOWTO

   We are working on a HOTWO for the Web Key Directory.  For now
   please consult the [[https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD][Wiki]].

** GPGME Python Bindings HOWTO

   Written "in house" by the GnuPG Project core team, the GPGME Python
   Bindings HOWTO provides detailed instructions and examples for
   using the Python bindings of the GPGME API with Python 3 code.

   This HOWTO is available:

   -  in its original Emacs Org Mode source form in the GPGME repository ( [[https://dev.gnupg.org/source/gpgme/browse/master/lang/python/docs/GPGMEpythonHOWTOen.org][en]] )
   -  as a single HTML file ( [[http://files.au.adversary.org/crypto/GPGMEpythonHOWTOen.html][en]] )
   -  as a single HTML file with dark background and light text ( [[http://files.au.adversary.org/crypto/GPGMEpythonHOWTOen-dark.html][en]] )

** GnuPG SmartcardHOWTO

   GnuPG supports the use of smartcards.  This HOWTO explains how to
   install and work with these cards.

   - as on-line browsable HTML files ( [[../howtos/card-howto/en/smartcard-howto.html][en]] )
   - as one big HTML file ( [[../howtos/card-howto/en/smartcard-howto-single.html][en]] )
   - as plain text ( [[../howtos/card-howto/en/smartcard-howto.txt][en]] )

   This smartcard howto is also available in the [[../download/git.org][source repository]].

** Legacy GnuPG MiniHOWTO

   /These howtos mostly describe the legacy version 1.4 of GnuPG/

   You may get the best overview about the GnuPG system by reading the
   mini HOWTO available in several formats:

** GnuPG Keysigning Party HOWTO

   /Due to problem with the keyservers, this howto should be considered
   historic./

   Once you get familiar with GnuPG's mechanisms, you surely wouldn't
   miss one of its funnest (and useful) aspects: to meet your Internet
   buddies and get your key signed by as many of them as possible.

   But having to check tens or even hundreds of keys at a meeting may
   become quite frustrating. Here it is where this HOWTO by V. Alex
   Brennen comes in handy. It is a guide to understanding and
   organizing a PGP keysigning party. Keysigning parties help build
   and strengthen the web of trust which serves to make the use of
   GnuPG more secure.

   This HOWTO is available:

   -  as an on-line browsable set of HTML files (
   [[http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/gpg-party/gpg-party.de.html][de]] ·
   [[http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/keysigning_party/en/keysigning_party.html][en]] ·

** Mutt-GnuPG HOWTO

   /This howto might not be up to the current GnuPG version./

   Firstly, because everyone should be using encryption and signatures
   in their email. Secondly, because there are absolutely no reason
   for you not to be using PGP-compatible software. Thirdly, because
   documentation is mostly geared toward someone who is already
   familiar with PGP.  Fourtly, because we like to promote both GnuPG
   and Mutt as free software project, for use in everyday
   communications. Lastly, because Justin R.  Miller likes writing
   tutorials.

   For all these reasons, you can find below a link to Justin's HOWTO
   on how to send and receive cryptographically signed and/or
   encrypted email with GnuPG and the [[http://www.mutt.org/][Mutt mail reader]].

   This HOWTO is available:

   -  as plain text ( [[http://codesorcery.net/old/mutt/][en]] )

** PHP-GnuPG HOWTO

   /This howto might not be up to the current GnuPG version./

   With the preponderance of javascript based OpenPGP solutions to
   various functions on the web, the desire to perform certain types
   of server side functions on a PHP driven website also has its
   merits.

   While PHP support for GPGME is either lacking, or too arcane for
   most developers to decipher, or both; Piotr Masełkowski at
   [[https://maslosoft.com/][Maslosoft]] has an alternative guide using the CLI programs.

   This HOWTO is available:

   -  as an online HTML article ( [[https://maslosoft.com/blog/2017/09/12/using-gpg-with-php-on-server/][en]] )
