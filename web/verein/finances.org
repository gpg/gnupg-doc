The 59.000 € from the Wau Holland Stiftung have been collected by them
for the GnuPG project since 2013.  After the Verein reached charitable
state they were able to transfer that money.  Many thanks to them.

We have produced two postcards to be used as giveaways at shows and
other opportunities.  Our account has not yet been charged for
printing costs.

** Bitcoin transactions

   As of 2017-10-06 we own 0.12 BTC.  26 BTC have been
   transferred to our Euro account (see above).
