* The Membership Token

  *This is currently under development*

Member of the Verein may receive a dedicated crypto token to secure
their communication.  The token will implement the OpenPGP card
specification and we will make the membership number a part of the
token's serial number.

Obviously the hardware and the software will be under a free license.
We will use the Gnuk token from our founding member Niibe-san.
