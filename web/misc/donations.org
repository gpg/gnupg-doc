  Maintaining and improving GnuPG is costly. For more than 10 years
  now, g10^code, a German company owned and headed by GnuPG's
  principal author Werner Koch, is bearing the majority of these
  costs. To help them carry on this work, they need your support.

  Please consider to visit the [[http://g10code.com/gnupg-donation.html][GnuPG donation page]] over at the
  g10^code GmbH site.
