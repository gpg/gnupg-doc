** Remarks

   For many years we maintained translation of these pages to French,
   German, Italian, and Spanish.  A big thank you to the translators:
   Jean-Francois Paris, Walter Koch, Cristian Rigamonti, and Noel
   David Torres Taño.  Because we didn’t always managed to keep those
   translation up to date, we decided in 2013 to abandon them.  In
   case translations are again demanded by users and sufficient
   resources are available, the tentative plan is to setup individual
   sites per language with language or country specific information.

   Former version of these web pages have been marked as copyrighted
   by the /Free Software Foundation/.  However, a formal act to
   transfer the copyright to them has never been conducted. Thus in
   2013 these notices have been replaced by a reference to the list of
   individual copyright holders.
