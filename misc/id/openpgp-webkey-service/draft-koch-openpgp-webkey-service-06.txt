1.  Introduction

   This memo describes a method to associate OpenPGP keys with a mail
   address and how to look them up using a web service with a well-known
   URI.  In addition a mail based protocol is given to allow a client to
   setup such an association and to maintain it.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Web Key Directory

   A major use case for OpenPGP is the encryption of mail.  A common
   difficulty of sending encrypted mails to a new communication partner
   is to find the appropriate public key of the recipient.  Unless an
   off-channel key exchange has been done, there are no easy ways to
   discover the required key.  The common practice is to search the
   network of public key servers for a key matching the recipient's mail
   address.  This practise bears the problem that the keyservers are not
   able to give a positive confirmation that a key actually belongs to
   the mail addresses given in the key.  Further, there are often
   several keys matching a mail address and thus one needs to pick a key

   on good luck.  This is clearly not a secure way to setup an end-to-
   end encryption.  Even if the need for a trusted key for an initial
   mail message is relinquished, a non-authenticated key may be a wrong
   one and the actual recipient would receive a mail which she can't
   decrypt, due to the use of a wrong key.

   Methods to overcome this problem are

   o  sending an initial unencrypted message with the public key
      attached,

   o  using the OpenPGP DANE protocol to lookup the recipients key via
      the DNS.

   The first method has the obvious problems of not even trying to
   encrypt the initial mail, an extra mail round-trip, and problems with
   unattended key discovery.

   The latter method works fine but requires that mail providers need to
   set up a separate DNS resolver to provide the key.  The
   administration of a DNS zone is often not in the hands of small mail
   installations.  Thus an update of the DNS resource records needs to
   be delegated to the ISP running the DNS service.  Further, DNS
   lookups are not encrypted and missing all confidentially.  Even if
   the participating MUAs are using STARTTLS to encrypt the mail
   exchange, a DNS lookup for the key unnecessarily identifies the
   local-part of the recipients mail address to any passive
   eavesdroppers.

   This memo specified a new method for key discovery using an encrypted
   https connection.

3.1.  Key Discovery

   Although URIs are able to encode all kind of characters,
   straightforward implementations of a key directory may want to store
   the local-part of a mail address directly in the file system.  This
   forbids the use of certain characters in the local-part.  To allow
   for such an implementation method the URI uses an encoded form of the
   local-part which can be directly mapped to a file name.

   OpenPGP defines its User IDs, and thus the mail address, as UTF-8
   strings.  To help with the common pattern of using capitalized names
   (e.g.  "Joe.Doe@example.org") for mail addresses, and under the
   premise that almost all MTAs treat the local-part case-insensitive
   and that the domain-part is required to be compared case-insensitive
   anyway, all upper-case ASCII characters in a User ID are mapped to
   lowercase.  Non-ASCII characters are not changed.

Internet-Draft          OpenPGP Web Key Directory               May 2018


   The so mapped local-part is hashed using the SHA-1 algorithm.  The
   resulting 160 bit digest is encoded using the Z-Base-32 method as
   described in [RFC6189], section 5.1.6.  The resulting string has a
   fixed length of 32 octets.  To form the URI, the following parts are
   concatenated:

   o  The scheme "https://",

   o  the domain-part,

   o  the string "/.well-known/openpgpkey/hu/",

   o  and the above constructed 32 octet string.

   For example the URI to lookup the key for Joe.Doe@Example.ORG is:

     https://example.org/.well-known/openpgpkey/
     hu/iy9q119eutrkn8s1mk4r39qejnbu3n5q

   (line has been wrapped for rendering purposes)

   DNS SRV resource records ([RFC2782]) may be used to query a different
   host or a port other than 443.  For example:

     _openpgpkey._tcp.example.org.  IN  SRV 0 0 8443 wkd.example.org.

   changes the above to query the host "wkd.example.org" at port 8443
   instead of the host "example.org" at port 443.  The target (in the
   example "wkd.example.org") MUST be a sub-domain of the domain-part
   (here "example.org").  If the target is not a sub-domain, the SRV RR
   MUST be be ignored.  The recommended name for the sub-domain is
   "wkd".

   The HTTP GET method MUST return the binary representation of the
   OpenPGP key for the given mail address.  The key needs to carry a
   User ID packet ([RFC4880]) with that mail address.  Note that the key
   may be revoked or expired - it is up to the client to handle such
   conditions.  To ease distribution of revoked keys, a server may
   return revoked keys in addition to a new key.  The keys are returned
   by a single request as concatenated key blocks.

   The server MUST accept the HTTP HEAD method to allow a client to
   check for the existence of a key.

   The server SHOULD use "application/octet-string" as the Content-Type
   for the data but clients SHOULD also accept any other Content-Type.
   The server MUST NOT return an ASCII armored version of the key.

   The server MUST serve a Policy Flags file as specified below.  That
   file is even required if the Web Key Directory Update Protocol is not
   supported.

4.  Web Key Directory Update Protocol

   To put keys into the key directory a protocol to automate the task is
   desirable.  The protocol defined here is entirely based on mail and
   the assumption that a mail provider can securely deliver mail to the
   INBOX of a user (e.g. an IMAP folder).  Note that the same protocol
   may also be used for submitting keys for use with OpenPGP DANE.

   We assume that the user already created a key for her mail account
   alice@example.org.  To install the key at her provider's Web Key
   Directory, she performs the following steps:

   1.  She retrieves a file which contains one line with the mail
       address used to submit the key to the mail provider.  The DNS SRV
       rules described for the Web Key Directory apply here as well.
       See below for the syntax of that file.  For a mail address at the
       domain "example.org" the URI of the file is

       https://example.org/.well-known/openpgpkey/submission-address

   2.  She sends her key using SMTP (or any other transport mechanism)
       to the provider using the submission address and key format as
       specified by PGP/MIME.

   3.  The provider checks that the received key has a User ID which
       matches an account name of the provider.

   4.  The provider sends an encrypted message containing a nonce and
       the fingerprint of the key to the mail account of the user.  Note
       that a similar scheme is used by the well known caff(1) tool to
       help with key signing parties.

   5.  A legitimate user will be able to decrypt the message because she
       created the key and is in charge of the private key.  This step
       verifies that the submitted key has actually been created by the
       owner of the account.

   6.  The user sends the decrypted nonce back to the submission address
       as a confirmation that the private key is owned by her and that
       the provider may now publish the key.  Although technically not
       required, it is suggested that the mail to the provider is
       encrypted.  The public key for this is retrieved using the key
       lookup protocol described above.

Internet-Draft          OpenPGP Web Key Directory               May 2018


   7.  The provider receives the nonce, matches it with its database of
       pending confirmations and then publishes the key.  Finally the
       provider sends a mail back to the user to notify her of the
       publication of her key.

   The message data structures used for the above protocol are specified
   in detail below.  In the following sections the string "WELLKNOWN"
   denotes the first part of an URI specific for a domain.  In the
   examples the domain "example.org" is assumed, thus

     WELLKNOWN := https://example.org/.well-known/openpgpkey

   The term "target key" denotes the to be published key, the term
   "submission key" the key associated with the submission-address of
   the mail provider.

4.1.  The Submission Address

   The address of the submission file is

     WELLKNOWN/submission-address

   The file consists of exactly one line, terminated by a LF, or the
   sequence of CR and LF, with the full mail address to be used for
   submission of a key to the mail provider.  For example the content of
   the file may be

     key-submission-example.org@directory.example.org

4.2.  The Submission Mail

   The mail used to submit a key to the mail provider MUST comply to the
   PGP/MIME specification ([RFC3156], section 7), which states that the
   Content-Type must be "application/pgp-keys", there are no required or
   optional parameters, and the body part contains the ASCII-armored
   transferable Public Key Packets as defined in [RFC4880], section
   11.1.

   The mail provider MUST publish a key capable of signing and
   encryption for the submission-address in the Web Key Directory or via
   DANE.  The key to be published MUST be submitted using a PGP/MIME
   encrypted message ([RFC3156], section 4).  The message MUST NOT be
   signed (because the authenticity of the signing key has not yet been
   confirmed).  After decryption of the message at the mail provider a
   single "application/pgp-keys" part, as specified above, is expected.

Internet-Draft          OpenPGP Web Key Directory               May 2018


4.3.  The Confirmation Request

   The mail provider sends a confirmation mail in response to a received
   key publication request.  The message MUST be sent from the
   submission-address of the mail provider to the mail address extracted
   from the target key.  The message needs to be a PGP/MIME signed
   message using the submission key of the provider for the signature.
   The signed message MUST have two parts:

   The first part MUST have "text" as its Content-Type and can be used
   to explain the purpose of the mail.  For example it may point to this
   RFC and explain on how to manually perform the protocol.

   The second part MUST have "application/vnd.gnupg.wkd" if the protocol
   version of the server is 5 or later; without a known protocol version
   or a version less than 5, "application/vnd.gnupg.wks" MUST be used as
   its Content-Type and carry an OpenPGP encrypted message in ASCII
   Armor format.  The message MUST be encrypted to the target key and
   MUST NOT be signed.  After decryption a text file in the Web Key data
   format must be yielded.

   That data format consists of name-value pairs with one name-value
   pair per LF or CR+LF terminated line.  Empty lines are allowed and
   will be ignored by the receiver.  A colon is used to terminate a
   name.

   In a confirmation request the following names MUST be send in the
   specified order:

   o  "type": The value must be "confirmation-request".

   o  "sender": This is the mailbox the user is expected to sent the
      confirmation response to.  The value must match the mailbox part
      of the "From:" address of this request.  Exactly one address MUST
      be given.

   o  "address": The value is the addr-spec part of the target key's
      mail address.  The value SHOULD match the addr-spec part of the
      recipient's address.  The value MUST be UTF-8 encoded as required
      for an OpenPGP User ID.

   o  "fingerprint": The value is the fingerprint of the target key.
      The fingerprint is given in uppercase hex encoding without any
      interleaving spaces.

   o  "nonce": The value is a string with a minimum length of 16 octets
      and a maximum length of 64 octets.  The string must entirely be
      made up of random ASCII letters or digits.  This nonce will be



Koch                    Expires November 19, 2018               [Page 7]

      sent back to the mail provider as proof that the recipient is the
      legitimate owner of the target-key.

   The receiver of that message is expected to verify the outer
   signature and disregard the entire message if it can't be verified or
   has not been signed by the key associated with the submission
   address.

   After the message as been verified the receiver decrypts the second
   part of the message, checks that the "fingerprint" matches the target
   key, checks that the "address" matches a User ID of the target key,
   and checks the other constrains of the request format.  If any
   constraint is not asserted, or the fingerprint or User ID do not
   match the target key, or there is no pending publication requests
   (i.e. a mail recently sent o the submission address), the user MAY be
   notified about this fake confirmation attempt.

   In other cases the confirmation request is legitimate and the MUA
   shall silently send a response as described in the next section.

   The rationale for the outer signature used with this request is to
   allow early detection of spam mails.  This can be done prior to the
   decryption step and avoids asking the user to enter a passphrase to
   perform the decryption for a non-legitimate message.  The use of a
   simple encrypted attachment, instead of using PGP/MIME encryption, is
   to convey the Content-Type of that attachment in the clear and also
   to prevent automatic decryption of that attachment by PGP/MIME aware
   clients.  The MUA may in fact detect this confirmation request and
   present a customized dialog for confirming that request.

4.4.  The Confirmation Response

   A response to a confirmation request MUST only be send in the
   positive case; there is no negative confirmation response.  A mail
   service provider is expected to cancel a pending key submission after
   a suitable time without a confirmation.  The mail service provider
   SHOULD NOT retry the sending of a confirmation request after the
   first request has been send successfully.

   The user MUST send the confirmation response from her target mail
   address to the "from" address of the confirmation request.  The
   message MUST be signed and encrypted using the PGP/MIME Combined
   format ([RFC3156], section 6.2).  The signing key is the target key
   and the encryption key is the key associated with the provider's
   submission address.

   The Content-Type used for the plaintext message MUST match the
   Content-Type of the request.  The format is the same as described



Koch                    Expires November 19, 2018               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          OpenPGP Web Key Directory               May 2018


   above for the Confirmation Request.  The body must contain three
   name-value pairs in this order:

   o  "type": The value must be "confirmation-response".

   o  "sender": The value must match the mailbox part of the "From:"
      address of this response.  Exactly one address MUST be given.

   o  "nonce": The value is the value of the "nonce" parameter from the
      confirmation request.

4.5.  Policy Flags

   For key generation and submission it is useful to tell the client
   about certain properties of the mail provider in advance.  This can
   be done with a file at the URL

     WELLKNOWN/policy

   A site supporting the Web Key Directory MUST serve this file; it is
   sufficient if that file has a zero length.  Clients may use this file
   to check for Web Key Directory support.

   The file contains keywords and optionally values, one per line with
   each line terminated by a LF or the sequence of CR and LF.  Empty
   lines and lines starting with a '#' character are considered comment
   lines.  A keyword is made up of lowercase letters, digits, hyphens,
   or dots.  An underscore is allowed as a name space delimiters; see
   below.  The first character must be a letter.  Keywords which are
   defined to require a value are directly followed by a colon and then
   after optional white space the value.  Clients MUST use case-
   insensitive matching for the keyword.

   Currently defined keywords are:

   o  "mailbox-only": The mail server provider does only accept keys
      with only a mailbox in the User ID.  In particular User IDs with a
      real name in addition to the mailbox will be rejected as invalid.

   o  "dane-only": The mail server provider does not run a Web Key
      Directory but only an OpenPGP DANE service.  The Web Key Directory
      Update protocol is used to update the keys for the DANE service.

   o  "auth-submit": The submission of the mail to the server is done
      using an authenticated connection.  Thus the submitted key will be
      published immediately without any confirmation request.

Internet-Draft          OpenPGP Web Key Directory               May 2018


   o  "protocol-version": This keyword can be used to explicitly claim
      the support of a specific version of the Web Key Directory update
      protocol.  This is in general not needed but implementations may
      have workarounds for providers which only support an old protocol
      version.  If these providers update to a newer version they should
      add this keyword so that the implementation can disable the
      workaround.  The value is an integer corresponding to the
      respective draft revision number.

   o  "submission-address": An alternative way to specify the submission
      address.  The value is the addr-spec part of the address to send
      requests to this server.  If this keyword is used in addition to
      the "submission-address" file, both MUST have the same value.

   More keywords will be defined in updates to this I-D.  There is no
   registry except for this document.  For experimental use of new
   features or for provider specific settings, keywords MUST be prefixed
   with a domain name and an underscore.

5.  Security Considerations

   The use of SHA-1 for the mapping of the local-part to a fixed string
   is not a security feature but merely used to map the local-part to a
   fixed-sized string made from a well defined set of characters.  It is
   not intended to conceal information about a mail address.

   The domain name part of the mail address is not part of the hash to
   avoid problems with internationalized domain names.  Instead a
   separate URL is required for each domain name.

   The use of DNS SRV records reduces the certainty that a mail address
   belongs to a domain.  For example an attacker may change the target
   to a host in a sub-domain under their control and thus gain full
   control over all keys.  An implementation may want to weight the
   certainty of a mapping different if it has been retrieved via a sub-
   domain and in particular if a non-recommended name is used for the
   sub-domain.

   To make it a bit harder to test for published keys, the server
   responsible to serve the WELLKNOWN directory SHOULD NOT create an
   index file for that directory or any sub-directory.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Note that GnuPG version 2.1.12 supports the key discovery described
   in version -00 of this document (auto-key-locate method "wkd").
   Version 2.1.16 can run the protocol described in this document but is
   also able to run the protocol version specified by -01.  For backward
   compatibility this example uses the Content-Type as required for
   versions of this protocol prior to -04; if the client knows that the
   server support -04 "vnd.gnupg.wkd" should be used.
